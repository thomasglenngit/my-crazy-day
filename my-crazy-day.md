# MY CRAZY DAY
The transmission had been slippling on my Honda Odyssey. But, I don't have time to fix it. I just push forward, ignore it, hoping that luck or serendipity will protect me. 

Well, last week, while I had it parked on the driveway, it slipped out of gear. Just as I was stepping out of the driver's side, it started rolling backward down the driveway. The open door came in contact with our Jeep parked adjacent to it. 

I immediately ran out of the way as the contact between the two cars pushed the driver-side door way out of position, the hinge snapping in two. 

I was glad I escaped because I could have been mamed or killed. 

Anyway, I spent the rest of the day on the phone with the insurance guys.
